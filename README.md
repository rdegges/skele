## Purpose

Lately, I find myself building a lot of [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) web
apps.  Unfortunately, every single time I start a new project, there's always a
ton of stuff I have to do:

- Setup the project structure in a *sane* way.
- Download and install all the middleware I typically use.
- Get user registration and authentication up-and-running.
- Create registration / login / dashboard pages.
- Hook up billing stuff with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
- Setup email with [Sendgrid](http://sendgrid.com/).
- Deploy it to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
- And tonssss of other stuff.

**Ugh.**

It gets tiring doing that every time, for reals.

And while there are some pretty decent *"skeleton"* apps out there I could use,
I've looked at all of them and I'm honestly not really impressed.

Hence, *skele*.

The purpose of *skele* is to provide a fucking **KICK-ASS**, simple,
best-practices, and *highly opinionated* Express.js skeleton project that you
can use as a template for starting new SaaS-type web apps.

If you are planning on writing a SaaS-type web service, CHECK THIS OUT.

It provides all the sorta stuff you'd expect:

- User authentication.
- Payment plans.
- User dashboard / billing / etc.
- Sane DB structure.
- Deployment.
- etc.

*skele* is going to make your life a whole lot easier, or at least I hope it
does.

And if you get stuck anywhere?  Just [hit me up!](mailto:r@rdegges.com).  I'm
like the easier person to get in contact with, and I'm happy to answer
questions, etc.
